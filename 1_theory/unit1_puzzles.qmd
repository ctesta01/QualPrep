# History 

It would be rather bland if I only spent all summer cramming, so I'll try to 
capture the big picture as well.

One of the things I loved about the presentation in our Probability class (BST 230)
was that we had a brief unit on the history of probability at the beginning. 

I trust that the reader can peruse the following references on their own: 

  * [Wikipedia: History of Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory#History_of_probability)
  * [Blogpost on History of Probability](https://bcss.org.my/tut/bayes-with-jags-a-tutorial-for-wildlife-researchers/probability/a-brief-history-of-probability/)

# Puzzles

Our course made a great deal about motivating examples like: 

  * [The Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
  * [The Exchange Paradox / Two Envelopes Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem)
  * [The St. Petersburg Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)

What I learned from these examples is that almost no matter how good your na√Øve
intuition is, formalizing your assumptions and using line-by-line justified
proofs seems much more likely to land you at a valid conclusion than heuristic
reasoning. And while I don't expect the Gambler's Fallacy to appear on a
qualifying exam, I certainly wouldn't want to be caught off-guard by a
puzzle-style problem that stresses exactly this skill of translating a
word-problem into a formal, mathematical setup and asking us to follow through
on its logical consequences. 

To some extent, I wish to find a compendium of probability-themed puzzles, and I have a
few leads that I have not yet verified: 

  * I strongly suspect that Martin Gardner's writing [@gardner1956mathematics; @gardner2005colossal] strongly emphasizes probability puzzles, so I'll try to select
  a few to do from his work. In a similar vein, I'm not sure if I can find old copies of 
  the American Statistician, but I know the Monty Hall puzzle was originally 
  proposed as a puzzle in the American Statistician, so that may be a fruitful 
  place to look. 
  * I have also found that the Institute of Mathematical Statistics has a 
  *Student Puzzle Corner* here: <https://imstat.org/2023/12/15/student-puzzle-corner-48/>
  * Following the *See Also* section from the Monty Hall Problem Wikipedia page yields 
  [the Sleeping Beauty Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem) and 
  [the Boy or Girl Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_girl_paradox).
