The min or max heap property:

> "Max-heaps must maintain the heap property that the parent values must be greater than their children." --<https://www.codecademy.com/article/max-heaps-conceptual> 

> "In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greater than or equal among the keys present at all of its children." --<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-min-heap-and-max-heap/>

> "Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. We refer to this condition as the heap invariant." --<https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html>
