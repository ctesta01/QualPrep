On the other hand, statistical inference allows us to go from observed data and combine it with assumptions to draw conclusions inductively, which may or may not be correct. For example, a statistical statement might be that a particular way of constructing a confidence interval (under assumptions) has a 95% probability of containing the true population parameter when repeatedly performing the same experiment (e.g., in the Frequentist paradigm).",

    "section": "Monty Hall Problem",
    "text": "Monty Hall Problem\nThe Monty Hall problem can be stated so simply:\n\nSuppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host [Monty], who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of Monty Hall Problem: 3 doors, 3rd is open showing a goat\n\n\nHow should you ‘model’ your choices?\nDo we have all the information necessary?\nWe need to know: is there an equal initial probability of the car being behind each door? We’ll assume yes. Let’s additionally assume that Monty never reveals the car, and if he has a choice between two doors with goats behind them, he picks randomly either with probability \\(1/2\\).\nLet \\(M_i\\) denote the event where Monty opens the \\(i\\)th door. Also, let \\(D_i\\) denote the event where the car is behind door \\(i\\). We will assume as in the puzzle given that we have chosen door 1 and Monty has shown us there is a goat behind door 3.\nNotice that \\(P(D_1) = P(D_2) = P(D_3) = 1/3\\) by our first assumption. (These are unconditioned probabilities, before we learn anything). Our second assumption then implies the following table of probabilities for the joint events \\(P(M_i \\text{ and } D_j \\mid \\text{we chose door 1})\\) for \\(i, j \\in \\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}\\).\n\n\n\nJoint probabilities for where the car is and what door Monty shows\n\n\nBayes’ Rule Approach:\nNow we want to compare \\(P(D_1 | M_3)\\) vs. \\(P(D_2 | M_3)\\). We can use Bayes’ rule to calculate this using quantities we either already have or can get.\n\\[P(D_1 | M_3) = \\frac{P(M_3 | D_1)P(D_1)}{P(M_3)} = \\frac{(1/2) \\times (1/3)}{(1/2)} = \\frac{1}{3}.\\] \\[P(D_2 | M_3) = \\frac{P(M_3 | D_2)P(D_2)}{P(M_3)} = \\frac{1 \\times (1/3)}{(1/2)} = \\frac{2}{3}.\\]\nJustifications: We take by assumption that we chose door 1, so Monty will never choose door 1, and hence \\(P(M_3) = 1/2\\). In the first case, Monty’s hand is not forced. In the second case, Monty’s hand is forced, and hence \\(P(M_3 | D_2) = 1\\).\nThus we conclude that it is superior to switch to door 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDerivation of Bayes’ Formula\nRecall the definition of conditional probability. \\[P(A | B) = P(A \\cap B) / P(B), \\quad \\quad P(B | A) = P(A \\cap B) / P(A)\\] \\[\\implies \\; P(A | B) P(B) = P(B | A) P(A)\\] \\[\\therefore P(B | A) = \\frac{P(A | B) P(B)}{P(A)}.\\]\n\n\nDirect Approach:\nYou could say, can’t we just use the definition of conditional probability straight away? Yes, you can. Essentially it’s constructing the above table that’s the important part in seeing the solution clearly.\n\\[P(D_1 | M_3 ) = \\frac{P(D_1 \\cap M_3)}{P(M_3)} = \\frac{1/6}{1/2} = \\frac{1}{3}.\\] \\[P(D_2 | M_3 ) = \\frac{P(D_2 \\cap M_3)}{P(M_3)} = \\frac{1/3}{1/2} = \\frac{2}{3}.\\]\nProblematic Approach:\nWhat’s wrong with saying \\(M_3\\) implies that either \\(D_1\\) or \\(D_2\\) must hold, so \\[P(D_1 | M_3) = \\frac{P(D_1 \\cap M_3)}{P(M_3)} = \\frac{P(D_1 \\cap \\{ D_1, D_2 \\})}{P(\\{D_1, D_2\\})} = \\frac{1/3}{2/3} = \\frac{1}{2},\\] and by the fact that \\(P(D_2 | M_3) = 1-P(D_1|M_3)\\), we have that \\(P(D_2 | M_3) = 1/2\\) as well, where \\(P(\\{D_1, D_2\\})\\) refers to the probability of either the car being behind door 1 or door 2.\nWell, \\(M_3\\) and \\(\\{D_1, D_2\\}\\) are not the same events. It is true that \\(M_3\\) implies the car is behind either door one or door two, but it’s not the case that the door being behind either door one or door two implies that Monty will open door 3. If they’re not the same events, then we cannot assume that their probabilities are equal. Hence, the above steps incorrectly replace \\(P(M_3)\\) with 2/3, and \\(P(D_1 \\cap M_3)\\), and in the numerator, the joint probability of \\(P(D_1 \\cap M_3)\\) need not equal \\(P(D_1 \\cap \\{ D_1, D_2 \\}) = P(D_1)\\).",

    "text": "Puzzle #1\n\nThere are 43 cookies to be given out at random to 10 children. What is the probability that each child gets at least 10 cookies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise in flawed thinking.\n\nFind the flaw in the following logic:\nConsider the outcomes where each child has 2+ cookies. Then, for 20 cookies, we already know how those are distributed (each of the 10 children gets two cookies). The remaining 23 cookies can be assigned arbitrarily, so across the 10 kids there are a remaining \\(10^{23}\\) ways to distribute the cookies for each of the \\({43 \\choose 20}\\) ways that the 20-cookies already spoken-for can be distributed.\nThat gives us \\[\\frac{P(\\text{ways to get to every child having 2+ cookies})}{P(\\text{total number of ways to distribute 43 cookies})} =\n\\frac{{43 \\choose 20} \\cdot 10^{23}}{10^{43}} = \\frac{{43 \\choose 20}}{10^{23}}.\\]\n\n\nClick to reveal the problem in the above logic.\n\nI think we’re double-counting solutions when we say that for each of the \\({43 \\choose 20}\\) ways that we can say that the 20 cookies are already spoken for, there are another \\(10^{23}\\) ways to assign the other cookies.\nLet’s take a smaller example: assigning 4 cookies to 2 students, and I want to know how often to expect each student gets 1+ cookie. If I consider outcomes where cookies 1, 2, 3, 4 get assigned to children \\(1, 2, *, *\\), I would count \\(1,2,1,2\\) towards this tally. But if I later also consider outcomes of the form \\(*, *, 1, 2\\), I would again count the outcome \\(1,2,1,2\\) twice. This is wrong, and a crucial mistake.\nIn general, the real flaw was in not adequately formalizing our work and using heuristics like “if cookies are spoken for,” which is not a rigorously defined probability concept.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, notice that this is a classic multinomial setup. The multinomial distribution can be thought of as giving the probability of observing the outcome \\(i \\in \\{ 1, ..., k \\}\\) coming up \\(x_i\\) times when rolling a \\(k\\)-sided die \\(n\\) times, and is a generalization of the Binomial distribution. We have that the probability of each outcome \\(i\\) coming up on a single roll is given by \\(\\pi_i\\).\nIf the so-called die is fair, \\(\\pi_i = \\pi_{i'}\\; \\forall i, i' \\in \\{ 1, ..., k\\}\\) or the die is unfair and \\(\\pi_i\\) is not necessarily equal to \\(\\pi_i'\\). In all cases, we assume \\(\\sum \\pi_i = 1\\).\nLet \\(X = (X_1, ..., X_k)\\) be a \\(\\text{Multinomial}(n, \\pi)\\) distributed where \\(\\pi = (\\pi_1, ..., \\pi_k)\\).\nThe density of the Multinomial distribution is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(X = x) & = {n \\choose x_1,...,x_k!} \\prod_{i=1}^k \\pi_i^{x_i} \\\\\n& = \\frac{n!}{x_1!\\cdots x_k!}\\pi_1^{x_1} \\cdots \\pi_k^{x_k}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIntuition\n\nI think of it this way: in the traditional Binomial outcome, there’s two outcomes that are being tallied, 1 or 0, and either 1 happens with probability \\(\\pi_1\\), or 0 happens with probability \\(1-\\pi_1\\) in each trial. Here, the \\(\\sum \\pi_i = 1\\) assumption is making it so that either outcome \\(i\\) happens with probability \\(\\pi_i\\), or one of the other \\(i' \\in \\{ 1, ..., k\\} \\backslash i\\) outcomes happens with probability \\(1 - \\pi_i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Multinomial Theorem\n\nFor any positive integer \\(m\\) and non-negative integer \\(n\\), \\[(x_1 + ... + x_m)^n = \\sum_{k_1+...+ k_m = n} {n \\choose k_1, ..., k_m} \\prod_{i=1}^m x_i^{k_i},\\] where \\(k_1, ..., k_m \\in \\mathbb N\\) and \\({n \\choose k_1, ..., k_m} = \\frac{n!}{k_1!\\cdots k_m!}\\).\n\n\n\nReturning to the problem, let \\(p_n\\) denote the probability that all 10 children receive at least 2 cookies each given that \\(n\\) are given out uniformly at random.\nLet \\(X_1, ..., X_{10}\\) denote the random variables representing how many cookies each of the 10 children gets. Notice that \\[\n{\\small\nX_1, ..., X_{10} \\Bigg\\vert \\sum_{i=1}^{10} X_i = 43 \\sim\n\\text{Multinomial}(n = 43, k = 10, \\pi_i = 1/10),}\n\\] where \\(\\pi_i = 1/10\\) indicates that the distribution of cookies is uniformly random (e.g., equal probability) across the 10 children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoisson-Multinomial Relationship\nThe Poisson and Multinomial distributions have an interesting relationship. When the outcomes \\(X_1, ..., X_k\\) are such that \\(X_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\), then \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k X_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i).\\)\nOne can easily derive via the definition of conditional probability that \\[(X_1, ..., X_k) {\\Bigg\\vert} \\sum_{i=1}^k X_i = N = n \\sim \\text{Multinomial}(n, k, \\pi),\\] where \\(\\pi = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\sum \\lambda_i}, ..., \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\sum \\lambda_i}\\right)\\).\nSee here for example.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(X = x \\Big \\vert N = n) & = \\frac{P(X = x, N = n)}{P(N = n)}  \\\\\n& = \\frac{P(X = x)}{P(N = n)} \\\\\n& = \\left( \\frac{e^{-\\sum \\lambda_i} \\prod \\lambda_i^{x_i}}{\\prod x_i!} \\right) \\Bigg / \\left( \\frac{e^{-\\sum \\lambda_i} (\\sum \\lambda_i)^{n}}{n!} \\right) \\\\\n& = {n \\choose x_1, ..., x_k} \\frac{\\prod \\lambda_i^{x_i}}{\\left( \\sum \\lambda_i \\right)^n} \\\\\n& = {n \\choose x_1, ..., x_k} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\sum \\lambda_i} \\right)^{x_i} \\\\\n& \\sim \\text{Multinomial}(n, k, \\pi).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSince no information was given to us about how it came about that \\(n = 43\\) cookies were given out, let’s assume that it was the result of a \\(\\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\) process. This implies that the \\(X_i\\) are independently and identically distributed as \\(\\text{Poisson}(\\lambda/10)\\) by a similar argument in the reverse direction.\n\n\\[P(X = x \\Bigg| \\sum X_i = n) = \\frac{P(X = x, \\sum X_i = n)}{\\underbrace{P(\\sum X_i = n)}_{\\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)}},\\] and \\(X = x \\implies \\sum X_i = \\sum x_i = n\\), so \\(P(X = x, \\sum X_i = n) = P(X = x)\\) as long as \\(n = \\sum x_i\\). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\therefore \\;\\; P(X = x) & = P(X = x \\Bigg| \\sum X_i = n) \\cdot P(\\sum X_i = n) \\\\\n& = \\left[ {n \\choose \\pi_1, ..., \\pi_k} \\prod \\pi_i^{x_i} \\right] \\cdot \\left( \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{\\sum x_i}}{\\sum x_i! } \\right) \\\\\n& = \\frac{\\cancel{n!}}{x_1!\\cdots x_k!} \\pi_1^{x_1}\\cdots \\pi_k^{x_k} \\left( \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{n}}{\\cancel{n!}} \\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Assume as given in the problem that the cookies are uniformly randomly given out, and \\(\\pi_i = \\pi_{i'}\\;  \\forall i, i' \\in \\{ 1, ..., k \\}\\); this single probability must be \\(1/k\\) (or in our case, \\(k = 10\\) children).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(X = x) & = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}}{x_1! \\cdots x_k!} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{k} \\right)^{\\sum x_i} \\\\\n& = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\frac{e^{-\\lambda/k} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{k} \\right)^{x_i}}{x_i!}, \\\\\n\\text{a product of the }&\\text{density for $k$ iid Poisson}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{k}\\right) \\text{ variables}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWe said that if \\(n\\) cookies are given out, then there’s a \\(p_n\\) probability that the 10 children all receive 2+ cookies. Then without conditioning on the number of cookies given out, the probability that all kids receive 2+ cookies is given by \\[\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^n}{n!} p_n.\\]\nOn the other hand, the probability that all 10 kids receive 2+ cookies is \\(P(X_1 \\geq 2)^{10} = (1-P(X_1 \\leq 1))^{10} =\n(1-e^{-\\frac{\\lambda}{10}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{10}e^{-\\frac{\\lambda}{10}})^{10},\\) since it’s clear that \\(X_1, ..., X_{10}\\) are independently and identically distributed.\nNow we have that \\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^n}{n!} p_n\n=\n\\left[1-e^{-\\frac{\\lambda}{10}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{10}e^{-\\frac{\\lambda}{10}}\\right]^{10}.\n\\]\n\n\nReference materials on Poissonization and related ideas.\n\nSo, I didn’t know the first thing about “Poissonization,” but I’ve been trying to learn.\nIt appears that Mary Wootters [site] and C. Seshadhri [site] have nice online YouTube playlists of their randomized algorithms lectures in which they talked about Poissonization.\nSee the specific videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P71s05H2T5E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lvfTKiLyXw\n\nI get the sense that the Chernoff bound for the Poisson-tail is something I should learn about further. The application of Stirling’s approximation to the distribution of deviations from the expected value of a Poisson process that Seshadhri presents is quite beautiful, and something I’d like to learn more about.\nThere’s also this interesting approximation of the Multinomial cell-specific count outcomes as Poisson that I saw popping up here and there (Ahmad 1985).\n\n\nAhmad, I. A. 1985. “On the Poisson Approximation of Multinomial Probabilities.” Statistics & Probability Letters 3 (1): 55–56. https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-7152(85)90013-6.\nNow, recall that \\(e^{x}\\) has a series expansion. If we multiply both sides by \\(e^{\\lambda}\\) and by \\(43!\\), we should find that the coefficient on the left-hand-side series for \\(\\lambda^{43}\\) is just \\(p_n\\), and the right-hand-side series coefficient for \\(\\lambda^{43}\\) gives an expression we can evaluate for \\(p_{43}\\). They must be equal, because in order for two convergent power series to coincide on a non-empty interval, their coefficients must be equal.\nSo what we’re going to do is expand the function \\(e^{x} = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^t}{t!}\\) wherever we see it on the modified right-hand-side and use that to identify the coefficient of \\(\\lambda^{43}\\), which is \\(p_{43}\\).\nHowever, this is a bit hard to do by hand, so we’ll use the symbolic algebra library sympy in Python to do it for us.\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, factorial, series, Pow\n\nlambda_ = symbols('lambda')\n\ninner_expression = 1 - exp(-lambda_/10) - (lambda_/10)*exp(-lambda_/10)\n\nraised_expression = inner_expression**10 \n\ncomplete_expression = exp(lambda_) * raised_expression\n\nexpanded_series = series(complete_expression, x=lambda_, n=44).removeO()\n\ncoeff_lambda_43 = expanded_series.coeff(lambda_**43)\n\np_43 = factorial(43) * coeff_lambda_43\np_43\n\\[\n\\frac{38360235213946776318553037176114920309}{78125000000000000000000000000000000000} \\approx 0.491\n\\]\nThus we conclude that if 43 cookies are given out to 10 children uniformly at random, then the probability that each child receives at least 2 cookies is \\(\\approx .491.\\)\nLet’s see if we can confirm that via a simple simulation in R:\nset.seed(1234)\n\nnum_trials &lt;- 100000  # Number of simulations\nnum_children &lt;- 10    # Number of children\nnum_cookies &lt;- 43     # Number of cookies\n\nresults &lt;- replicate(num_trials, {\n  cookies &lt;- sample(1:num_children, num_cookies, replace = TRUE)\n  counts &lt;- table(factor(cookies, levels = 1:10))\n  all(counts &gt;= 2)\n})\n\nprob_estimate &lt;- mean(results)\nvar_estimate &lt;- var(results) / num_trials\n\nprob_estimate\nvar_estimate\n&gt; prob_estimate\n[1] 0.49178\n&gt; var_estimate\n[1] 2.499349e-06\nAlright, I think I’m happy with that.",
