title: Inference 
citation-location: document

Largely the inference material comes from [@casella2002statistical], though some of the later theory around 
point-estimation and hypothesis testing comes from [@lehmann2022testing; @lehmann1998theory]. Unfortunately, for much of the material towards the end (on 
the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimates and the Wald, Score, and Likelihood Ratio Tests) the course materials refer heavily to notes from [Robert Gray](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/robert-gray/) ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QyY7JGIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)), and I don't believe his 
notes are publicly available, nor do I have permission to share them. As such, I'll 
try to find corroborating references for the same material when I get to that point.
