Welcome to my notes from Summer 2024!  These notes are principally for me to
organize my thinking as I prepare for my PhD qualifying exams in Probability and
Statistical Inference, (Statistical) Methods, and Data Structures & Algorithms.
If they're helpful to you, I'd love to hear about it!  If you spot errors,
please let me know. There is a commenting system enabled 
so that you can leave comments, and with support for LaTeX equations too! 

Enjoy!
