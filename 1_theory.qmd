Largely the probability and inference material that we will be examined on 
comes from [@casella2002statistical], though some of the later theory around 
point-estimation and hypothesis testing comes from [@lehmann2022testing; @lehmann1998theory]. Unfortunately, for much of the material towards the end (on 
the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimates and the Wald, Score, and Likelihood Ratio Tests) the course materials refer heavily to notes from [Robert Gray](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/robert-gray/) ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QyY7JGIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)), and I don't believe his 
notes are publicly available, nor do I have permission to share them. As such, I'll 
try to find corroborating references for the same material when I get to that point. 

For the probability-focused material, we may also refer to a handful of other references
including [@blitzstein2019introduction; @bishop2006pattern; @gut2009intermediate; @stoyanov2013counterexamples; @Feller1968; @DasGupta2011; @Durrett2019].

At a high-level, how do we distinguish Probability and Statistics? 

In general, these are answers to dual problems:  Probability theory gives 
us the tools to carry out deductive reasoning, where based on _perfect, complete knowledge_ of 
random processes, we can derive true statements about the result (e.g., statements
about expectation, variance, etc.). On the other hand, statistical inference
allows us to go from _observed data_ and combine it with assumptions to 
draw conclusions inductively, which may or may not be correct. For example, a
statistical statement might be that a particular way of constructing a confidence interval 
(under assumptions) has a 95% probability of containing the true population parameter when 
repeatedly performing the same experiment (e.g., in the Frequentist paradigm).
