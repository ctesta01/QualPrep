The probability material can be mostly found in [@casella2002statistical].

For the probability-focused material, we may also refer to a handful of other references
including [@blitzstein2019introduction; @bishop2006pattern; @gut2009intermediate; @stoyanov2013counterexamples; @Feller1968; @DasGupta2011; @Durrett2019].

At a high-level, how do we distinguish Probability and Statistics? 

In general, these are answers to dual problems:  Probability theory gives 
us the tools to carry out deductive reasoning, where based on _perfect, complete knowledge_ of 
random processes, we can derive true statements about the result (e.g., statements
about expectation, variance, etc.). On the other hand, statistical inference
allows us to go from _observed data_ and combine it with assumptions to 
draw conclusions inductively, which may or may not be correct. For example, a
statistical statement might be that a particular way of constructing a confidence interval 
(under assumptions) has a 95% probability of containing the true population parameter when 
repeatedly performing the same experiment (e.g., in the Frequentist paradigm).
