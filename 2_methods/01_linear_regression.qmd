Our typical problem is to estimate the 
linear relationship between $Y$ and $p$ covariates/predictors $(x_1, ..., x_p)$. 

In modeling, we can distinguish between the *systematic* 
and *random* parts of a model. 

Consider the model: 

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_p x_{ip}, \quad i = 1, ..., n,$$

with the assumptions: 

  1. (Size of Data) $p < n$, 
  1. (Mean-Zero Error) $\E(\varepsilon_i) = 0$
  1. (Homoscedasticity) $\Var(\varepsilon_i) = \sigma^2$, 
  1. (Uncorrelated Error) $\Cov(\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_j) = 0.$
